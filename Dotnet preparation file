Definitions
String: In C#, a string is an immutable sequence of characters. This means once a string object is created, it cannot be changed. Any modification to a string results in the creation of a new string object.
StringBuilder: The StringBuilder class in C# is used to represent a mutable string of characters. Unlike string, StringBuilder allows you to modify the string without creating a new object, making it more efficient for scenarios where you need to perform multiple modifications to a string.
Examples
String Example
C#

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string str = "Hello";
        str += " World"; // This creates a new string object
        Console.WriteLine(str); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In this example, the += operator creates a new string object each time it is used, which can be inefficient if done repeatedly.

StringBuilder Example
C#

using System;
using System.Text;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.Append(" World"); // This modifies the existing StringBuilder object
        Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString()); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
In this example, the Append method modifies the existing StringBuilder object, making it more efficient for multiple modifications.

When to Use Which
Use string when the value is not expected to change frequently.
Use StringBuilder when you need to perform multiple modifications to a string, such as in loops or complex string manipulations.
