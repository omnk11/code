what information we needed and from where we will get the data whenever we are fetching the data.

query is fetch the third highest salary from Employee table.

Select TOP 1 salary from (select top 3  EmployeeInfor

select salary from Employeeinfo order by salary DESC LIMIT (2,1); 

//here limit is taking offset and number of row which we need to fetch. 
2 means after 2 and 1 means after 2 we need to fetch 1 row 

QUESTION 2 : fetch the duplicate row

select *, count(empid) from Employee Group by emipid having empid>1;

question 3: fetch even and ODD records.
//here we will us the MOD function which takes divident and divisor (empid, 2) 
select * from emplyee where MOD(empid,2)=0;//Even 
select * from employee where MOD(empid,2)=1//odd

SUBQUERY: query inside query 

//find first and last value from the table 

select * from employee where empid=(select max(empid) from employee)

//coppy from one table to another 


Insert into ABC select * from  from cbc;

INSERT INTO target_table
SELECT *
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;

question: write a query to fetch the employee working in same department

here we are spliting our table into 2 table by giving the alias E and E1 

Select Distinct  E.empid,E.Employeename, E.DepartmentName from Employee E join Employee E1 on e.department=e1.departmentid where e.empid!=e1.empid;

// Delete duplicate record from table 
here will use the self join 

DELETE E1 from Employee E1 join EMployee E2 on e1.empemail=e2.email Where e1.empid>e2.empid;


//when we are working with date --> sql understood YYMMDD format 

so in this case we will use STR_TO_DATE('01-02-2023','%D,%M,%Y); it will convert in YMD format.

fetch the employee where date of joining is between some date.

NOT IN Operator:

select the records where employee is not from HR or developement

slect * from employee where Department Not in ('HR', 'Developement');


// two minimum salries from the table 

SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC
LIMIT 2;

question: create table from another table using same schema or structure.
Create tabel ABC  as (select * from Employee where 1=2);

//insert
Insert into ABC select * from Employees;
